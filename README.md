 this code is for assignment2.
 for this project I have choosed Posts component from the jsonplaceholder api.
 The Posts component fetches a list of posts from the API and displays them in a structured format.
 This data contains userId, id, title and body. Its an array of objects
 there are few tasks to be given for this assignment. So I created saparate function for each task and then called them in one function for code clarity.


for Build a frequency map I have fetched data from another api. 'https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s='
which contains meals data. I have created a frequency map for all ingredients and how many times they appeared in data.
