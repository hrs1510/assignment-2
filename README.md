 this code is for assignment2.
 for this project I have choosed Posts component from the jsonplaceholder api.
 The Posts component fetches a list of posts from the API and displays them in a structured format.
 This data contains userId, id, title and body. Its an array of objects
 there are few tasks to be given for this assignment. So I created seperate function for each task and then called them in one function for code clarity.
